The probable reason for this discrepancy is that a theory has to be written down; and some kind of record exists from the moment of inception. Technology, at least in its youthful stages, is quite different. It is basically a “hands-on” tinkering process; relatively little is written down at the moment of creation, making it difficult (and occasionally impossible) to later reconstruct the history of the key discoveries and their discoverers.

The main goals are to develop algorithms to convert time-migration velocities to true seismic velocities, and to convert time-migrated images to depth images in regular Cartesian coordinates. Our main results are three-fold. First, we establish a theoretical relation between the true seismic velocities and the 'time-migration velocities' using the paraxial ray tracing. Second, we formulate an appropriate inverse problem describing the relation between time-migration velocities and depth velocities, and show that this problem is mathematically ill posed, i.e., unstable to small perturbations. Third, we develop numerical algorithms to solve regularized versions of these equations which can be used to recover smoothed velocity variations. Our algorithms consist of efficient time-to-depth conversion algorithms, based on Dijkstra-like fast marching methods, as well as level set and ray tracing algorithms for transforming Dix velocities into seismic velocities. Our algorithms are applied to both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, and we test them on a collection of both synthetic examples and field data. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this paper, we formulate the problem as a non-linear least-squares optimization for seismic interval velocity and seek its solution iteratively. The input for the inversion is the Dix velocity, which also serves as an initial guess. The inversion gradually updates the interval velocity in order to account for lateral velocity variations that are neglected in the Dix inversion. The algorithm has a moderate cost thanks to regularization that speeds up convergence while ensuring a smooth output. The proposed method should be numerically robust compared to the previous approaches, which amount to extrapolation in depth monotonically. For a successful time-to-depth conversion, image-ray caustics should be either nonexistent or excluded from the computational domain. The resulting velocity can be used in subsequent depth-imaging model building. Both synthetic and field data examples demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.},

By weighting terms in the semblance calculation that are more sensitive to changes in velocity, we can increase resolution. Our implementation of weighted semblance is a straightforward extension of conventional semblance. Somewhat surprisingly, we increase resolution by choosing an offset-dependent weighting function that minimizes semblance. We test our method on synthetic and field data, and our tests confirm that weighted semblance provides higher resolution than conventional semblance.},

abstract = {Conventionally, interval velocities are derived from picked stacking velocities. The velocity‐analysis algorithm proposed in this paper is also based on stacking velocities; however, it eliminates the conventional picking stage by always considering stacking velocities from the point of view of an interval‐velocity model. This view leads to a model‐based, automatic velocity‐analysis algorithm. The algorithm seeks to find an interval‐velocity model such that the stacking velocities calculated from that model give the most powerful stack. An additional penalty is incurred for models that differ in smoothness from an initial interval‐velocity model. The search for the best model is conducted by means of a conjugate‐gradient method. The connection between the interval‐velocity model and the stacking velocities plays an important role in the algorithm proposed in this paper. In the simplest case, stacking velocity is assumed to be equal to rms velocity. For the more general case, a linear theory is developed, connecting interval velocity and stacking velocity through the intermediary of traveltime. When applied to a field data set, the method produces an interval‐velocity model that explains the lateral variation in both stacking velocity and traveltime.},

Picking is then much easier and consequently denser than in standard traveltime tomography. Stereotomography is the latest slope tomography method. In recent years it has been improved significantly, both from an algorithmic point of view and in terms of practical use. Robust and fast procedures are now available for 2D stereotomographic picking and optimization. Concerning the picking, we propose simple criteria for the selection of relevant data among the automatically picked events. This enables an accurate smooth velocity macromodel to be estimated quite rapidly and with very limited operator intervention.

Structure-oriented filters lead naturally to the computation of structure-oriented semblance, an attribute commonly used to highlight discontinuities in seismic images. Semblance is defined in this paper as simply the ratio of a squared smoothed-image to a smoothed squared-image. This definition of semblance generalizes that commonly used today, because an unlimited variety of smoothing filters can be used to compute the numerator and denominator images in the semblance ratio. The smoothing filters described in this paper yield an especially flexible method for computing structure-oriented semblance.},

On the one hand, low similarity corresponded to a noise point or a point indicating incorrect moveout, which should be given a small weight. On the other hand, high similarity corresponded to a point indicating correct moveout that should be given a high weight. Our approach could also be effectively used for analyzing AVO anomalies with increased resolution compared with AB semblance.

In practice, there are always some errors in the estimated local slopes, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) situations. Thus, subsurface velocity information may be hidden in the image domain spanned by velocity and other moveout parameters. We have developed an accelerated clustering algorithm to find cluster centers without prior information about the number of clusters. First, plane-wave destruction is implemented to estimate the local event slopes. For every sample in the seismic gathers, we obtain the estimations of velocity and its location in the image domain, according to the local event slopes. These mapped data points in the new domain exhibit the structure of groups. We represent these points by a mixture distribution model. Then, the cluster centers of the mixture distribution model are located, which correspond to maximum likelihood velocities of the main subsurface structures. Approximate velocity uncertainties bounds are used to select centers corresponding to reflections. Finally, interpolation is performed on the clustered unevenly sampled knot velocities to build the effective velocity model on regular grids. With synthetic and field data examples, we have determined that the proposed automatic velocity estimation method can give a stacking velocity model and a time migration velocity model with relatively high accuracy.},

Different image points receive different folds of reflection-angle illumination, which can be caused by irregular acquisition or by wave propagation in complex media.

Normalization by local similarity regularizes local illumination of reflection angles for each image point of the subsurface model. This approach compensates for irregular illumination by selective stacking in the image space, regardless of the cause of acquisition or propagation irregularities. Additional migration is not required because the methodology is implemented in the reflection angle domain after migration. We use two synthetic examples to demonstrate that our method can normalize migration amplitudes and effectively suppress migration artefacts. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Association of Geoscientists {\&} Engineers.},

@article{Liu2018,
abstract = {Local seismic event slopes contain subsurface velocity information and can be used to estimate seismic stacking velocity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate the stacking velocity automatically from seismic reflection data using similarity-weighted k-means clustering, in which the weights are local similarity between each trace in common midpoint gather and a reference trace. Local similarity reflects the local signal-to-noise ratio in common midpoint gather. We select the data points with high signal-to-noise ratio to be used in the velocity estimation with large weights in mapped traveltime and velocity domain by similarity-weighted k-means clustering with thresholding. By using weighted k-means clustering, we make clustering centroids closer to those data points with large weights, which are more reliable and have higher signal-to-noise ratio. The interpolation is used to obtain the whole velocity volume after we have got velocity points calculated by weighted k-means clustering. Using the proposed method, one obtains a more accurate estimate of the stacking velocity because the similarity-based weighting in clustering takes into account the signal-to-noise ratio and reliability of different data points in mapped traveltime and velocity domain. In order to demonstrate that, we apply the proposed method to synthetic and field data examples, and the resulting images are of higher quality when compared with the ones obtained using existing methods.},

abstract = {The physical basis, parameterization, and assumptions involved in root-mean-square (rms) velocity estimation have not significantly changed since they were first developed. However, these three aspects are all good targets for novel application of the recent emergence of machine learning (ML). Therefore, it is useful at this time to provide a tutorial overview of two state-of-the-art ML implementations; we have designed and evaluated classification and regression neural networks for the extraction of apparent rms velocity trajectories from semblance data. Both networks share a similar end-to-end trainable structure, except for the final layer. In the classification network, the velocity picking is performed by finding the largest amplitude trajectory through all velocity bins. The regression network, on the other hand, applies a differentiable soft-argmax function that converts the feature maps directly to apparent rms velocity values as functions of traveltime. Relative confidence maps can also be estimated from both neural networks. A large number of synthetic models with horizontal layers are created, and common-midpoint gathers are simulated from those models as training samples. Transfer learning is applied to fine-tune the networks with a small number of samples for testing with synthetic and field data from more complicated (2D) models. Tests using synthetic data show that the regression and classification networks can give reasonable velocity predictions from semblances, but the regression network gives higher accuracy.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Velocity analysis can be a time-consuming task when performed manually. Methods have been proposed to automate the process of velocity analysis, which, however, typically requires significant manual effort. We have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate stacking velocities directly from the semblance. Our CNN model uses two images as one input data for training. One is an entire semblance (guide image), and the other is a small patch (target image) extracted from the semblance at a specific time step. Labels for each input data set are the root mean square velocities. We generate the training data set using synthetic data. After training the CNN model with synthetic data, we test the trained model with another synthetic data that were not used in the training step. The results indicate that the model can predict a consistent velocity model. We also noticed that when the input data are extremely different from those used for the training, the CNN model will hardly pick the correct velocities. In this case, we adopt transfer learning to update the trained model (base model) with a small portion of the target data to improve the accuracy of the predicted velocity model. A marine data set from the Gulf of Mexico is used for validating our new model. The updated model performed a reasonable velocity analysis in seconds.},

Our aim is to find which aspects of these algorithms contribute to finding good clusterings, as opposed to converging to a low-quality local optimum. We describe each algorithm in a unified framework that introduces separate cluster membership and data weight functions. We then show that the algorithms do behave very differently from each other on simple low-dimensional synthetic datasets and image segmentation tasks, and that the A-harmonic means method is superior. Having a soft membership function is essential for finding high-quality clusterings, but having a non-constant data weight function is useful also.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models are the cornerstone of non- parametric Bayesian statistics, and the development of Monte-Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) sampling methods for DP mixtures has enabled the application of non- parametric Bayesian methods to a variety of practical data analysis problems. However, MCMC sampling can be prohibitively slow, and it is important to ex- plore alternatives. One class of alternatives is provided by variational methods, a class of deterministic algorithms that convert inference problems into optimization problems (Opper and Saad 2001; Wainwright and Jordan 2003). Thus far, varia- tional methods have mainly been explored in the parametric setting, in particular within the formalism of the exponential family (Attias 2000; Ghahramani and Beal 2001; Blei et al. 2003). In this paper, we present a variational inference algorithm for DP mixtures. We present experiments that compare the algorithm to Gibbs sampling algorithms for DP mixtures of Gaussians and present an application to a large-scale image analysis problem. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},
